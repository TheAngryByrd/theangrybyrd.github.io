## Nowin with Nginx on Linux

[Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/ "Nginx") [engine x] according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx) "is a open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server. The nginx project started with a strong focus on high concurrency, high performance and low memory usage."  

Nginx tries to address some of the issues with apache being "bloated."  Apache's defaults focuses on the processor/threading model while Nginx is based on an event-driven model.  The [Anturis blog](https://anturis.com/blog/nginx-vs-apache/) has a pretty good comparison of them.




[Nowin](https://github.com/Bobris/Nowin "Nowin") is a "Fast and scalable Owin Web Server in pure .Net 4.5."  It claims it's not ready for production but it works pretty well for testing Owin sites and works on mono.
