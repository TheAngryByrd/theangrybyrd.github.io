## Visual Studio 2015 Preview Android error.

So I've been playing with Visual Studio 2015 because I was curious about the [new Android emulator running in Hyper-V](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/11/12/introducing-visual-studio-s-emulator-for-android.aspx).  I paired it up with Xamarin and tried to test out a few apps.  THe only problem is the apps wouldn't launch nor would they run in the debugger.  I was getting a Mono.Debugger.Soft.ConnectionException message.
